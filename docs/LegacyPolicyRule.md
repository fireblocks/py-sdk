## Example

```python
from fireblocks.models.legacy_policy_rule import LegacyPolicyRule

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LegacyPolicyRule from a JSON string
legacy_policy_rule_instance = LegacyPolicyRule.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(LegacyPolicyRule.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
legacy_policy_rule_dict = legacy_policy_rule_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LegacyPolicyRule from a dict
legacy_policy_rule_from_dict = LegacyPolicyRule.from_dict(legacy_policy_rule_dict)
