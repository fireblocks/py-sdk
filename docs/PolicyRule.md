## Example

```python
from fireblocks.models.policy_rule import PolicyRule

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PolicyRule from a JSON string
policy_rule_instance = PolicyRule.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PolicyRule.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
policy_rule_dict = policy_rule_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PolicyRule from a dict
policy_rule_from_dict = PolicyRule.from_dict(policy_rule_dict)
