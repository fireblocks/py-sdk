json = "{}"
# create an instance of TravelRuleValidateTransactionResponse from a JSON string
travel_rule_validate_transaction_response_instance = TravelRuleValidateTransactionResponse.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(TravelRuleValidateTransactionResponse.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
travel_rule_validate_transaction_response_dict = travel_rule_validate_transaction_response_instance.to_dict()
